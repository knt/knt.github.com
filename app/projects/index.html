  <h2>EasyPrint</h2>

  <p>Spring 2009</p>
  <p>Tools: Flex (ActionScript), PHP</p>

  <p>EasyPrint is a web app for managing on-campus printing at MIT. The tool was a collaboration between three other students and I as our semester-long group project for the class 6.813 User Interface Design. We designed it completely and iteratively, from initial user and task analysis, paper and computer prototyping, to user testing, and implementation.</p>

  Features:
  <ul>
    <li>Shows the location and up-to-date status of all printers on MIT's campus</li>
    <li>Displays whether printers are active or stalled, the size of each print job currently on the queue, and the username the print job belongs to</li>
    <li>Users can upload files, set printing options, and send the files to any printer on campus; after sending files, users can delete jobs and determine their place in the queue</li>
  </ul>
