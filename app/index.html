    I am a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> in San Francisco, CA. I currently work on the core website team, building applications in Ruby on Rails that help people share what they're reading and find their next favorite book.

  <p>
    Outside of programming, I love coffee and coffee shops, bike riding, and my cat Theo...and of course I spend quite a bit ot time <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2305920-nichole">reading.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated from MIT with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Course 6) in 2010. In addition to the Rails stack, my past work has included Java, Hadoop and HBase, and Python and Django.
